#### **1. Executive Summary**  
Tech Solutions, Inc. proposes an incremental approach to developing the **Smart Parking Management System (SPMS)** for the City of Techville. This plan includes a fully detailed timeline and cost estimate for three feature increments, each delivering value to users while ensuring progress toward the final product. The total project cost is **$950,000**, with a delivery timeline of **12 months**.

---

#### **2. Solution Overview**  
Our proposed SPMS will be developed in the following key increments, with each phase building on the previous one to deliver a complete, fully functional system by the end of the project:

1. **Increment 1: Core Parking Locator & Navigation (3 months)**  
   - Real-time parking spot availability using existing IoT sensors.  
   - Basic GPS navigation for open-air parking lots.  
   - Simple parking reservation system.  
   - Core backend infrastructure for real-time data processing.

2. **Increment 2: Payment Integration & Notifications (3 months)**  
   - Secure payment options (credit cards, digital wallets).  
   - Push notifications for reservation expiry and parking availability.  
   - Indoor navigation using Bluetooth beacons for underground garages.

3. **Increment 3: User Experience Enhancements (2 months)**  
   - Advanced reservation features (extend, modify, cancel).  
   - Predictive parking availability based on historical data.  
   - Integration of user-generated feedback for non-IoT parking lots.

#### **5. Risk Management Plan**

We acknowledge that large-scale projects like SPMS face certain risks, and we have developed strategies to mitigate them:

1. **Technology Integration Risk:**  
   The integration of IoT sensors from multiple vendors poses a challenge. To mitigate this, we will conduct early compatibility tests during Phase 1 to identify any integration issues and resolve them before full-scale development begins.

2. **Indoor Navigation Challenges:**  
   GPS may not work well in certain environments, such as underground parking. To address this, we will deploy Bluetooth-based beacons for indoor navigation in parking garages.

3. **Security Risks:**  
   Payment systems must meet the highest security standards. We will use proven, secure payment gateways that comply with PCI-DSS regulations to protect user data and prevent fraud.

4. **Scope Creep:**  
   To prevent the project from expanding beyond initial expectations, we will set clear deliverables and milestones in the contract and regularly review the scope with city stakeholders to ensure alignment.
