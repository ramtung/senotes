#### **1. Executive Summary**  
Tech Solutions, Inc. proposes an incremental approach to developing the **Smart Parking Management System (SPMS)** for the City of Techville. This upfront plan includes a fully detailed timeline and cost estimate for four feature increments, each delivering value to users while ensuring progress toward the final product. The total project cost is **$950,000**, with a delivery timeline of **12 months**.

---

#### **2. Solution Overview**  
Our proposed SPMS will be developed in the following key increments, with each phase building on the previous one to deliver a complete, fully functional system by the end of the project:

1. **Increment 1: Core Parking Locator & Navigation (3 months)**  
   - Real-time parking spot availability using existing IoT sensors.  
   - Basic GPS navigation for open-air parking lots.  
   - Simple parking reservation system.  
   - Core backend infrastructure for real-time data processing.

2. **Increment 2: Payment Integration & Notifications (3 months)**  
   - Secure payment options (credit cards, digital wallets).  
   - Push notifications for reservation expiry and parking availability.  
   - Indoor navigation using Bluetooth beacons for underground garages.

3. **Increment 3: User Experience Enhancements (2 months)**  
   - Advanced reservation features (extend, modify, cancel).  
   - Predictive parking availability based on historical data.  
   - Integration of user-generated feedback for non-IoT parking lots.

4. **Increment 4: Public Transit Integration & System Scaling (3 months)**  
   - Integration with public transportation data to suggest parking near transit hubs.  
   - System scalability for new parking areas (e.g., private lots or street parking).  
   - Multi-language support.

#### **5. Upfront Risk Management Plan**

Even with a detailed upfront plan, there are known risks that could affect the projectâ€™s schedule or cost. These risks include:

1. **Technology Integration Risks:** The integration of IoT sensors, Bluetooth beacons, and GPS systems may not go as smoothly as planned.
2. **Payment System Compliance:** Future regulations could necessitate additional work to comply with financial security standards.
3. **User Feedback Adjustments:** After the deployment of early increments, feedback may prompt changes in features or system behavior.
4. **Scalability Issues:** Scaling the system for additional parking areas may be more complex than anticipated, impacting Increment 4.

Despite these risks, we believe our incremental approach will allow the project to stay on track by addressing these challenges as we move through each phase.
